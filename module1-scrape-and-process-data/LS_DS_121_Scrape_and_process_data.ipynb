Have you been looking to contribute to an open source project, but you don't know where to start? BeeWare is a set of software libraries for cross-platform native app development from a single Python codebase and tools to simplify app deployment. The project aims to build, deploy, and run apps for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iPhone, and the web. It is native because it is actually using your platform's native GUI widgets, not a theme, icon pack, or webpage wrapper. This talk will teach you how Toga, the BeeWare GUI toolkit, is architected and then show you how you can contribute to Toga by creating your own GUI widget in five easy steps.</td>\n",

This talk will explore the details of what happens, how the descriptor protocol works, and how it can be used to alter the Python object model.   \n",

Account takeovers happen for a variety of reasons -- password re-use, compromised computers, guessable passwords, and more. This talk gives you concepts and concrete skills that will help you identify and prevent account takeovers and limit the damage. It’s inspired by practices in use at GitHub, Google, and the Python Package Index.   \n",

Have you been putting off submitting your job applications because you think you won't be ready to interview until you do \"just one more\" day of studying?  In this talk, you'll learn which concepts are the most important to study for entry-level roles and how to use your Python skills to convey your understanding of these concepts with confidence and clarity.   \n",

But most likely, they’re doing it wrong, just like we did. By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code. We’ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming with Python’s `asyncio` library, take away some best practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.   \n",
